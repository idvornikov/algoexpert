Relational Database

A type of structured database in which data is stored following a tabular
format; often supports powerful querying using SQL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Relational Database

In contrast with relational database (SQL databases), a type of database that
is free of imposed, tabular-like structure. Non-relational databases are often
referred to as NoSQL databases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL

Structured Query Language. Relational databases can be used using a derivative
of SQL such as PostgreSQL in the case of Postgres.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Database

Any database that supports SQL. This term is often used synonymously with
"Relational Database", though in practice, not <i>every</i> relational
database supports SQL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NoSQL Database

Any database that is not SQL-compatible is called NoSQL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACID Transaction

A type of database transaction that has four important properties:

Atomicity:
The operations that constitute the transaction will either all succeed or all fail.
There is no in-between state.

Consistency:
The transaction cannot bring the database to an invalid
state. After the transaction is committed or rolled back, the rules for each
record will still apply, and all future transactions will see the effect of
the transaction. Also named <b>Strong Consistency</b>.

Isolation:
The execution of multiple transactions concurrently will have the same effect as if
they had been executed sequentially.

Durability:
Any committed transaction is written to non-volatile storage. It will not be undone
by a crash, power loss, or network partition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database Index

A special auxiliary data structure that allows your database to perform
certain queries much faster. Indexes can typically only exist to reference
structured data, like data stored in relational databases. In practice, you
create an index on one or multiple columns in your database to greatly speed
up <b>read</b> queries that you run very often, with the downside of slightly
longer <b>writes</b> to your database, since writes have to also take place in
the relevant index.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong Consistency

Strong Consistency usually refers to the consistency of ACID transactions, as opposed
to <b>Eventual Consistency</b>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventual Consistency

A consistency model which is unlike <b>Strong Consistency</b>. In this model,
reads might return a view of the system that is stale. An eventually
consistent datastore will give guarantees that the state of the database will
eventually reflect writes within a time period (could be 10 seconds, or
minutes).
