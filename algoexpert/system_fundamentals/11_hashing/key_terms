Consistent Hashing

A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped
when a hash table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to
distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get
forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing
servers are brought down.

Rendezvous Hashing

A type of hashing also coined <b>highest random weight</b> hashing. Allows for
minimal re-distribution of mappings when a server goes down.
